Lights Out Rules:
You are the green dot, your objective is to avoid the red ones. A yellow dot means both you and a red dot occupy the same space. Watch out!
You can Stop the game any time by flipping the switch off.
To start the game hold both buttons while 2 LEDs are flashing red until you hear "level start" (Make sure it isn't off).
At the start of each round all enemies are randomly placed on one of the ten neopixels (0-9) then you are shown the positions of each one and yourslef.
To play use the buttons after the three ticks to move. The left button(D4) moves you counter clockwise. The right button(D5) moves you clockwise. You get 5 beeps (5 seconds) before the lights are back on.
You gain 100 points each time you move and 1000 per round win!
Each round gets progressively harder, at first only enemies increase but after there are 9 the game moves faster and faster up to a difficulty of 7, which is 5 times faster!
If you get caught in the same spot as a red YOU LOSE!!!
As an added challege if you flip the switch before starting the game you can activate hard mode.
Hard mode increases the enemies and difficulty at the start, and alters the way each light is displayed.
Each light is displayed one at a time and only once requiring more and quick memorization.
